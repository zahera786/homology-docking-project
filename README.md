# homology-docking-project
This project involves the structural analysis of the GLT6D1 protein, which contains a glycosyltransferase 6 domain. The workflow includes sequence retrieval and alignment using BLAST, 3D model construction through homology modeling, and molecular docking to predict ligand-binding interactions.
